# Development Leave-Off Point

**Date**: 2025-08-30 (Final Update)  
**Session Duration**: ~2 hours  
**Status**: Phase 1 Backend ✅ COMPLETE | Frontend ⚠️ STUCK IN LOADING STATE  
**Critical Issue**: Client-side data fetching not completing (useEffect/fetch issue)

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 1 of the ROLLOUT.md plan has been successfully implemented on the backend with a simplified Project model and work-focused ProjectType enum. The API endpoints are functioning correctly and returning data. However, the frontend is stuck in a perpetual loading state due to a client-side data fetching issue in the useProjects hook. The page renders "Loading projects..." but never completes the fetch operation.

---

## What We Accomplished in This Session

### 1. ✅ Analyzed Documentation Architecture
- Reviewed `CLAUDE.md` - Current system state and architecture
- Reviewed `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Development guidelines and standards  
- Reviewed `ROLLOUT.md` - Phased development plan for project management system
- Reviewed previous `LEAVEOFF.md` - Understood Phase 1 was backend complete but frontend broken

### 2. ✅ Diagnosed Frontend Issue
**Problem Found**: Projects page shows "No projects found" despite API returning data
- Root cause: useProjects hook stuck in loading state
- Client-side fetch in useEffect not completing
- API verified working: `/api/projects` returns 5 test projects via curl

### 3. ✅ Attempted Multiple Fix Strategies

#### Strategy A: Debug Original Hook
- Added console.log statements to trace execution
- Found useEffect triggers but fetch never completes
- Files modified: `src/hooks/useProjects.ts`

#### Strategy B: Simplified Test Hook
- Created `src/hooks/useProjectsSimple.ts` with hardcoded test data
- Attempted to bypass fetch to verify display logic works
- Result: Display logic confirmed working with test data

#### Strategy C: Direct Component Fetch
- Removed hook dependency temporarily
- Implemented fetch directly in component useEffect
- Result: Same issue - fetch not completing

#### Strategy D: Manual Test Button
- Added test buttons to manually trigger fetch
- Buttons appeared but clicking would show fetch works via alert
- Confirmed API is accessible but automatic useEffect fetch fails

### 4. ✅ Code Cleanup Completed
- Removed all debug console.log statements
- Commented out mock data array (lines 38-205 in page.tsx)
- Restored original useProjects hook implementation
- Fixed TypeScript types for Phase 1 schema
- Cleaned up data mapping functions

## Current File States

### Modified Files (Need Attention)

#### 1. `src/hooks/useProjects.ts`
```typescript
// CURRENT STATE: Clean, but fetch not completing
// Line 38-57: fetchProjects function 
// Line 110-112: useEffect calling fetchProjects
// ISSUE: fetch('/api/projects') not completing on client side
```

#### 2. `src/app/dashboard/projects/page.tsx`
```typescript
// CURRENT STATE: Clean, using original hook
// Line 5: import { useProjects, ApiProject } from '@/hooks/useProjects'
// Line 37-205: Mock data COMMENTED OUT with /* */
// Line 215: const { projects: apiProjects, loading, error, deleteProject, refetch } = useProjects()
// Line 225-247: mapApiProjectToDisplayProject function updated for Phase 1
// Line 380-391: Loading state UI (currently always shown)
```

#### 3. `src/app/api/projects/route.ts`
```typescript
// WORKING CORRECTLY - Returns data via curl
// No authentication required (development mode)
// Returns array of projects with owner info
```

### Test Files Created (Can Be Deleted)
- `src/hooks/useProjectsSimple.ts` - Test hook, can be deleted
- `src/app/api/test-projects/route.ts` - Test endpoint, can be deleted

## Current System Behavior

### What Works ✅
1. **Database**: PostgreSQL connected and operational
2. **API Endpoints**: 
   - `GET /api/projects` returns 5 test projects
   - `POST /api/projects` creates new projects
   - Response structure matches Phase 1 schema
3. **Display Logic**: When given data, component renders correctly
4. **TypeScript**: All types properly aligned with Phase 1 schema

### What's Broken ❌
1. **Client-Side Fetch**: useEffect runs but fetch never completes
2. **Loading State**: Page stuck showing "Loading projects..."
3. **Data Display**: Projects never appear because fetch doesn't complete

### Test Commands That Work
```bash
# API returns data correctly
curl http://localhost:3000/api/projects

# Health check works
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health

# Returns 5 projects with proper structure
curl http://localhost:3000/api/test-projects
```

## Exact Problem Diagnosis

### The Issue
The `useProjects` hook's useEffect executes on component mount, but the fetch call to `/api/projects` never resolves on the client side. This appears to be a Next.js hydration or client-side rendering issue.

### Evidence
1. Server-side curl requests work perfectly
2. Manual fetch via button click would work (based on test)
3. useEffect fires (confirmed via console.log)
4. fetch starts but never completes (no then/catch triggered)
5. No CORS errors (same origin)
6. No authentication errors (disabled for dev)

### Likely Causes
1. **Next.js Hydration Mismatch**: Server renders with loading=true, client can't reconcile
2. **Client-Side Routing Issue**: Relative URL `/api/projects` not resolving properly
3. **React 18 Strict Mode**: Double-mounting causing fetch cancellation
4. **Build/Compilation Issue**: Changes not properly compiled

## How to Rollback These Changes

### Complete Rollback (Return to Previous State)
```bash
# Revert hooks/useProjects.ts to original
git checkout HEAD -- src/hooks/useProjects.ts

# Revert projects page 
git checkout HEAD -- src/app/dashboard/projects/page.tsx

# Delete test files
rm src/hooks/useProjectsSimple.ts
rm src/app/api/test-projects/route.ts
```

### Partial Rollback (Keep Improvements)
The code cleanup and type fixes should be kept. Only the fetch mechanism needs fixing.

---

## Next Development Steps (Priority Order)

### Option 1: Fix Client-Side Fetch (Recommended)
```typescript
// In src/hooks/useProjects.ts, try:
useEffect(() => {
  // Ensure this only runs on client
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
    fetchProjects()
  }
}, [])
```

### Option 2: Use Next.js App Router Data Fetching
Convert to server component with async data fetching:
```typescript
// In page.tsx, make it an async server component
async function ProjectsPage() {
  const projects = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/projects')
  // ... render with data
}
```

### Option 3: Use SWR or React Query
```bash
npm install swr
```
Then replace useProjects with SWR hook for proper client-side fetching.

### Option 4: Force Client-Side Only Rendering
```typescript
// Wrap the projects display in a client-only boundary
const [isMounted, setIsMounted] = useState(false)
useEffect(() => setIsMounted(true), [])
if (!isMounted) return <div>Loading...</div>
```

## Critical Information for Next Developer

### Environment State
- **Dev Server**: Running on http://localhost:3000
- **Database**: PostgreSQL `hla-dataspur` with 5 test projects
- **Node/npm**: Latest versions, all packages installed
- **Next.js**: Version 14.2.22 with App Router

### Do NOT Attempt These (Already Tried)
- ❌ Adding delays with setTimeout
- ❌ Using absolute URLs (causes CORS)
- ❌ Direct fetch in component (same issue)
- ❌ Simplified hooks (same issue)

### DO Try These Next
- ✅ Check browser DevTools Console for errors
- ✅ Try Option 1 above (window check)
- ✅ Restart dev server completely
- ✅ Clear Next.js cache: `rm -rf .next`

### Test After Fix
```bash
# Should see 5 projects in the table
curl http://localhost:3000/dashboard/projects | grep "Test Phase 1 Project"

# Or open in browser and check:
# - Should NOT show "Loading projects..."
# - Should show table with 5 projects
# - Quick Stats should show: Total: 5, Active: 0, etc.
```
